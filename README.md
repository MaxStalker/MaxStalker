## About me
<img src="portrait.jpg" alt="Yeah, this is me 😉" width="60%" height="auto"/>

Hello, my name is **Max Daunarovich**. I am a **Front-End Developer** with, what I believe, quite rare skill - extensive 
knowledge and production experience in the field of User Interface and User Experience design.
I live in the city of Minsk, Republic of Belarus.
Father of 4 lovely little "rascals" 😂

### Hard Skills
Being designer and developers is not an easy task and one need to know a lof of different tools and possess specific
skills in order to do the job right. Below you can find some of the stuff that I know I can do good:

- I know range of bitmap and vector editors - `Photoshop`, `Illustrator` and `Figma` are my main weapons in that field
- `AfterEffects` for motion graphics, reference and prototypes
- `Framer` for interaction prototypes
- My development toolbelt is revolving around `React` and libraries from React ecosystem: 
    - `Redux`, `MST` and `Mobx` for state management
    - `Styled Components`
    - `Styled System`
    - `Storybook`
- Different charting libraries - `Highcharts`, `React-Stockcharts`, `Chart.js` 
just to name a few
- When the job asks for it I can make some simple API utilizing `Node.js` and `Express.js`. Nothing fancy, that will blow
you mind, but it will do the work, until the heavy artillery in the face of back-end developers come to the aid.
- `Web3.js` and `Ethers.js` - while these are not the libraries I'm using on day-to-day basis, I have a working experience
of building web applications using them
- HTML template engines like `Mustache` and `Twig` (they don't suit my taste, but I know how to cook them)
- I know `CSS-Fu` and can express it with `Vanilla CSS` and `SASS/SCSS`. I am able to implement responsive design with 
and without additional CSS frameworks. I've utilized `BAM` methodology in several projects, though I might admit it's not
my strongest suit.

### Soft Skills
- **Initiative** - I can start and work on the problem without any additional guidance. If I will feel that the problem 
is too tough for me handle it alone or I'm missing some crucial piece of knowledge, I will consult every person, that might
have it 😊 
- **Open Minded** - I always listen to the person I'm interacting with, just to hear their line of reasoning and see that
maybe my line of thought is wrong 😊
- **High level of empathy** - I'm always there when there is person in need. I may sacrifice my own comfort and free time for
the sake of random person, who is currently stuck with problem I know I can solve.
- **Team Player** - I hate reaping the fruits of success alone. I'd rather finish last, but together with other team members,
knowing we've done all we collectively could.
- **Smart Worker** - might sound a bit like a bravado, but I believe there are a lot of cases, when you don't need to 
create solution from scratch and it would be much more productive to build on top of existing solutions and later on
refactor and improve it.
- **Smooth Talker** - if you don't shut me up I can talk for hours about politics, religion, comic books and games, conspiracy
theories and latest hot TV shows. You name it - and I probably have opinion on the topic. It might be not the deepest one,
but you won't be disappointed and at least would get a good `listener`
 
### Open Source Contribution
I had and chance to participate in several open source projects. Most noticeable are:
- [GitCoin](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web) - GitCoin was my very first open-source project, where I submitted a PR. 
Later I made some additional changes to visual design and HTML layout. [GitCoin results](https://gitcoin.co/results) still
sports icons I've designed in `Gitcoin Platform Stats` section
- [LeapDAO](https://github.com/leapdao) was building a Layer-2 scaling solution via plasma blockchain. I have participated 
in several repositories, contributing to smart contracts, front-end, documentation, tutorials and core development.
- [DEORA](https://github.com/deora-earth/voting-frontend) was building quadratic voting solution for VOLT party, building on 
top of Burner Wallet. My contribution included work on smart contracts and front-end design and development.
- [Planet A](https://github.com/social-dist0rtion-protocol/planet-a) is a social game built on top of Leap Network and
Burner Wallet.
- [Burner Wallet](https://github.com/burner-wallet) - several of the previously mentioned project, where utilizing the
Power of Burner Wallet and some of the solutions I've came up with, were pushed upstream.

### Personal Projects
- [Dungeon Riches](https://leap.dungeonriches.com) - Once upon a time I was working on a gambling site and thought if there
is a way to make it more fun and engaging... So I started a new project and called it **"Dungeon Riches"**. Originally it was
supposed to be built on top of Bitcoin node, but later it was ported to LeapNetwork chain. Unfortunately the game itself is 
currently down, due to the fact that LeapNetwork has killed testnet... Though, you can check how it supposed to 
be working [here](https://www.loom.com/share/be4e2265085442eca405097878e11e88). During development process I had a chance
to try so many hats:
    - Made game design and core gameplay - utulizing paper prototypes and quick build iterations
    - Developed Blockchain and LeapNetwork node interaction code
    - Tried different authorization solutions and databased solutions - `Firebase`, `Facebook API`, `passport`
    - Created setup with `Mongo` database and designed schema and models necessary for the game to operate
    - Developed visual representation of the game utilizing `pixi.js` rendering engine
    - Planned and managed *(maybe that's a strong word, provided I was mostly doing it alone)* features using `Trello` 
    and `Github Projects`
    - I even wrote a business plan and sent it together with application for the grant


### Fun Projects
From time to time I stumble into a new piece of technology or some fancy idea and I try to explore it and see what I can
build with it. Here's a list of the most recent:
- [Flow Playground Enhancer](https://github.com/MaxStalker/flow-playground-enhancer) - During my time fiddling with [Flow
Playground](https://play.onflow.org/) someone mentioned that editor is currently missing `dark mode`, so I thought to myself
how hard it would be to simply edit CSS in the dev tools and apply them every time one open a sandbox. Then to make it 
easier for end users I decided to build Chrome extension (the article I've read week prior suddenly came handy 😎). Long
story short - I've made one and then some more quality-of-life changes on top, which I and several other members of
Flow community were missing.
- **Figma Plugins** - In June 2019, **Figma** introduced API, which could have been used to create plugins to Figma
editor. The devs were really helpful and community responsive. I had a chance to build plugins, that I used to prepare
flyers for Berlin Blockchain Week. Build some fancy projects, like avatar generator and component factory, and help other
members, when they were stuck with some common problems. One of the best times in 2019 🤗
